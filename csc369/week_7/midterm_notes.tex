\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Virtualization}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item is an act of creating an illusion that there are as many hardware resource as each program needs.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Virtualizing CPU}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Turns a single CPU into a seemingly infinite number of CPUS, and
        allows many programs to seemingly run at once
        \item To implement CPU virtualization, the OS needs low-level machinery
        called \textbf{mechanism} and high level intelligence called \textbf{policies}
        \item Steps

        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
            \item Involve OS to setup hardware hardwre to limit what the process can do without OS assistance
            (\textbf{Limited Direct Execution})

            \bigskip

            This is done so by

            \bigskip

            \begin{enumerate}[1.]
                \item Setting up trap handler
                \item Starting an interrupt timer (so process won't last forever)
            \end{enumerate}
            \item Involve OS to intervene at key points to perform previleged operations
            or switch out operations when they have monopolized the CPU too long
        \end{enumerate}
        \bigskip
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Limited direct execution}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Is a mechanism of CPU virtualization
        \item Baby proofs the CPU by setting up hardwre to limit what the process can do without OS assistance
        \item Runs program in CPU once baby proofed
        \item Does so by
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Setting up trap handler
            \item Starting an interrupt timer (so process won't last forever)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Scheduling policies}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Are series of polices of CPU virtualization

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{First In First Out}
            \item \textbf{Shortest Job First}
            \item \textbf{Shortest Time-to-completion First}
            \item \textbf{Round Robin}
            \item \textbf{Multi-level Feedback Queue}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Virtualizing Memory}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Basic Idea: For the most part, let the program run directly on the hardware;
        however, at certain key points in time (e.g. system call, timer interrupt), arrange
        so that the OS gets involved and make sure the 'Right' thing happens.
        \item Like CPU, many programs are sharing the memory at the same time
        \item Like CPU, the goal is to create an illusion that it has its own code and data
        \item Like CPU, the memory also needs low-level machinery called \textbf{mechanism},
        and high level intelligence called \textbf{policies}
        \item Steps

        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
            \item Use \textbf{address translation} to transform each memory access,
            changing \textbf{virtual address} provided by instruction to \textbf{physical address}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Memory access includes instruction fetch, load, or store
                \item Is done using hardware
            \end{itemize}
            \item Invove OS at key points to \textbf{manage memory}

            \bigskip

            Memory management includes

            \bigskip

            \begin{enumerate}[1.]
                \item Setting up hardware so correct translations take place
                \item Keeping track of which locations are free and which are in use
                \item Judiciously intervening to maintain control over how memory is used
            \end{enumerate}

            \bigskip
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Address Translation}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Is also called \textbf{hardware-based address translation}
        \item Is a mechanism of memory virtualization
        \item Is the technique of transforming virtual address to physical address
    \end{itemize}

    % \item \textbf{Dynamic (Hardware-based) Relocation}

    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Is a type of address translation
    %     \item Occured in 1950's
    %     \item Is also referred as \textbf{base and bounds}
    %     \item Need \textbf{base register} and the \textbf{bounds}

    %     \begin{itemize}
    %         \item \textbf{base register} transforms virtual address to physical address
    %         \item \textbf{bound} ensures addresses are within confines of the address space
    %     \end{itemize}
    %     \item Steps

    %     \begin{enumerate}[1.]
    %         \item Write and compile program as if it is loaded at address zero
    %         \item Allow OS to decide where in physical memory it should be loaded
    %         and set base register to that value

\begin{itemize}
    \item The solution is written that \texttt{c)} can be read with 1 indirect pointers.
    I need to clarify with professor on this information.
    \item \textbf{Block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Size of each block is 4KB
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{lseek}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Syntax:} \texttt{off\_t lseek(int fildes, off\_t offset, int whence)}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{fildes} - file descriptor
            \item \texttt{offset} - file offset to a particular position in file

    \item \textbf{Kilobyte}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1 kilobyte is \underline{1024 bytes}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{file}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item is an array of bytes which can be created, read, written and deleted
        \item low-level name is called \textbf{inode number} or \textbf{i-number}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reading a File From Disk}

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Example}}

    \bigskip

    When

    \bigskip

    \texttt{open("/foo/bar", O\_READONLY)}

    \bigskip

    is called

    \bigskip

    \begin{itemize}
        \item the goal is to find the inode of the file \texttt{bar} to read its basic information
        (i.e. includes permission, information, file size etc)
        \item done by traversing the pathname and locate the desired inode
        \item Steps

        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
            \item Begin traversal at the root of the file system, in the \textbf{root directory}

            \item Find \textbf{inode} of the root directory by looking for \texttt{i-number}

            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{i-number} is found in it's parent directoy
                \item for root directory, there is no parent directory
                \item it's inode number is 2 (for UNIX file systems)
            \end{itemize}

            \item Read the \textbf{inode} of root directory
            \item Once its \textbf{inode} is read, look inside to find pointers
            to data blocks
            \item Recursively traverse the pathname until the desired inode is found (e.g \texttt{foo} $\to$ \texttt{bar})
            \item Issue a \texttt{read()} system call to read from file

            \begin{itemize}
                \item \texttt{fd} with offset \texttt{0} reads the first file block (e.g. \texttt{bar data[0]})
                \item \texttt{lseek(..., offset\_amt * size\_of\_file\_block)} is used to offset/move to desired block in \texttt{bar}
            \end{itemize}

            \item Trasnfer data to \texttt{buf} data block

            \item Close \texttt{fd}. No I/O is read.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{inode}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item total size may vary
        \item inode pointer has size of 4 byte
        \item Has 12 \textbf{direct pointers} to 4KB data blocks
        \item Has 1 \textbf{indirect pointer} [when file grows large enough]
        \item Has 1 \textbf{double indirect Pointer} [when file grows large enough]
        \item Has 1 \textbf{triple indirect Pointer} [when file grows large enough]
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Indirect Pointers}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Is allocated to data-block if file grows large enough
        \item Has total size of 4 KB or 4096 bytes
        \item Has $4096/4 = 1024$ pointers
        \item Each pointer points to 4KB data-block
        \item File can grow to be $(12 + 1024) \times 4\text{K} = 4144\text{KB}$
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Double Indirect Pointers}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item is allocated when single indirect pointer is not large enough
        \item each pointer in first pointer block points to another pointer block
        \item has $1024^2$ pointers
        \item each of $1024^2$ pointers point to 4KB data block
        \item File can grow to be $(12 + 1024 + 1024^2) \times 4\text{K} = 4198448\text{KB}$ or $\approx 4.20 \text{GB}$

    \item \textbf{Triple Indirect Pointers}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item is allocated when double indirect pointer is not large enough
        \item has $1024^3$ pointers
        \item each of $1024^3$ pointers point to 4KB data block
        \item File can grow to be $(12 + 1024 + 1024^2 + 1024^3) \times 4\text{K} = 4299165744\text{KB}$ or $\approx 4.00 \text{TB}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Old UNIX File system}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item was simple, and looked like the following on disk

        \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/midterm_1_solution_16.png}
        \end{center}
        \item has terrible performance
        \item suffers from \textbf{external fragmentation}
        \item had small data block (512 bytes) and transfer of data took too long
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Fast File System}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item modern file system has same APIS (\texttt{read()}, \texttt{write()}, \texttt{open()}, \texttt{close()})
        \item divides into a number of \textbf{cylinder groups}

        \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/midterm_1_solution_17.png}
        \end{center}
        \item each \textbf{block group} or \textbf{cylinder group} is consecutive
        portion of disk's address

        \end{center}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Bitmap}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Are excellent way to \underline{manage free space}
        \item tracks whether inodes/data block of the group are allocated
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{FFS Policies: Allocating Files and Directories}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Basic Idea: keep related stuff together, and keep related stuff
        far apart
        \item Directories Step

        \begin{enumerate}[1)]
            \item Find the \textbf{cylinder group} with a low number of allocated directories
            and a high number of free inodes

            \begin{itemize}
                \item low number of allocated directories $\to$ to balance directories
                across groups
                \item high number of free nodes $\to$ to subsequently be able to allocate a bunch offiles
            \end{itemize}
            \item Put directory data and inode to the \textbf{cylinder group}
        \end{enumerate}

        \item Files Step

        \begin{enumerate}[1)]
            \item Allocate the data blocks of a file in the same \textbf{cylinder group} as its inode
            \item Place all files in the same directory in the cylinder group of the directory they are in

            \bigskip

            \underline{\textbf{Example}}

            \bigskip

            On putting \texttt{/a/c}, \texttt{/a/d}, \texttt{/b/f}, FFS would place

            \begin{itemize}
                \item \texttt{/a/c}, \texttt{/a/d} as close as possible in the same \textbf{cylinder group},
                \item \texttt{/b/f} located far away (in some other \textbf{cylinder group})
            \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/midterm_1_solution_12.png}
    \end{center}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Is a short form for \textbf{index node}
        \item Contains disk block location of the object's data $^{[1]}$
        \item Contains all the information you need about a file (i.e. metadata)

        \begin{itemize}
            \item File Type
            \begin{itemize}
                \item e.g. regular file, directory, etc
            \end{itemize}

            \item Protection information
            \begin{itemize}
                \item such as who owns the file, as well as who can access it
            \end{itemize}
            \item Time information
            \begin{itemize}
                \item e.g. When file was created, modified, or last accessed
            \end{itemize}
            \item Location of data blocks reside on disk
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Crash Consistency}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Goal: How to update persistent data structures despite the presence of
        a \textbf{power loss} or \textbf{system crash}?
    \end{itemize}

    \end{center}


    \begin{enumerate}[1)]
        \item Just the data block (Db) is written to disk

        \bigskip

        \begin{itemize}
            \item No inode that points to it
            \item No bitmap that says the block is allocated
            \item It is as if the write never occured
            \item There is no problem here. All is well. (In file system's point of view)
        \end{itemize}

        \bigskip

        \item Just the updated inode (I[v2]) is written to disk

        \bigskip

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Inode points to the disk where \texttt{Db} is about to be written
            \item No bitmap that says the block is allocated
            \item No \texttt{Db} is written
            \item Garbage data will be read
            \item Also creates \textbf{File-system Inconsistency}

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Caused by on-disk bitmap telling us Db 5 is not allocated,
                but inode saying it does
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        \bigskip

        \item Just the updated bitmap (B[v2]) is written to disk

        \bigskip

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Bitmap indicates tht block 5 is allocated
            \item No inode exists at block 5
            \item Creates \textbf{file-system inconsistency}
            \item Creates \textbf{space-leak} if left as is

            \begin{itemize}
                \item block 5 can never be used by the file system
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        \bigskip

        \item Inode (I[v2]) and bitmap (B[v2]) are written to disk, and not data

        \bigskip

        \begin{itemize}
            \item File system metadata is completely consistent (in perspective of file system)
            \item Garbage data will be read
        \end{itemize}

        \bigskip

        \item Inode (I[v2]) and data block (Db) are written, but not the bit map

        \bigskip

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Creates \textbf{file-system inconsistency}
            \item Needs to be resolved before using file system again
        \end{itemize}

        \bigskip

        \item Bitmap (B[v2]) and data block (Db) are written, but not the inode (I[v2])

        \bigskip

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Creates \textbf{file-system inconsistency} between inode and data bitmap
            \item Creates \textbf{space-leak} if left as is
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Inode block is lost for future use
            \end{itemize}
            \item Creates \textbf{data-leak} if left as is

            \begin{itemize}
