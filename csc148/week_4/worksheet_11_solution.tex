\section*{Question 1}
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item Here, the constant time means the running time of accessing and
    assigning element by index doesn't depend on the length of the list.

    \item

    \begin{align*}
        n -i
    \end{align*}

    many elements need to be shifted to right.

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Notes:}}

    \bigskip

    \begin{itemize}
        \item

        The following example tells us

        \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8 \linewidth]{images/worksheet_11_q1b_notes.png}
        \end{center}

        to position an element at index $i = 3$ of the list, $n - i = 6 - 3 = 3$
        elements must be moved over.

        \bigskip

        Using this fact, we can generalize that to position an element at index $i$
        of the list, $n - i$ many elements must be shifted.

        \item Learned that when items shifts, it shifts into the expansion room.

        \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8 \linewidth]{images/worksheet_11_q1b_notes2.png}
        \end{center}
    \end{itemize}

    \item Because we know the list size stays as is when an element is removed, we can
    conclude 0 many list elements must be moved.

    \bigskip

        \underline{\textbf{Correct Solution:}}

        \color{red}
        The following example tells us

        \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/worksheet_11_q1c_correction.png}
        \end{center}

        when an element at index $i = 3$ is removed from the list $n - (i+1) =
        7 - (3 - 1) = 3$ many elements must be moved.

        \bigskip

        Using this fact, we can generalize that when an element is removed,
        $n - (i+1) = n - i - 1$ many elements must be shifted to left.

        \color{black}

    \end{mdframed}

    \item

    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
        \item

        A solution is \textit{LIST.remove(...)}.

        \bigskip

        The answer to question 1.d tells us when an element is removed, $n-i$
        must be shifted to left.

        \bigskip

        Using this fact, we can write a list of smaller size needs to shift elements less.

        \bigskip

        Then, it follows from this fact that $n = 100$ works faster than $n = 1,000,000$.

        \item

        A solution is \textit{LIST.append(...)}

        \bigskip

        The definition of append tells us that upon call, an element is added to
        the end of a list, it takes a constant time to add an element
        as long as the expansion room is not filled.

        \bigskip

        It follows from this fact that $n = 100$ and $n = 1,000,000$ takes roughly
        the same amount of time.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item

    The definition of \textit{Queue} tells us \textit{Queue} is FIFO. That is,
    the first element inserted is the first to come out.

    \bigskip

    Since we know the front of \textit{Queue} is the front of the list, we
    can conclude \textit{LIST.insert(...)} and \textit{LIST.pop(0)} are used
    to support \textit{QUEUE.enqueue} and \textit{QUEUE.dequeue}, respectively.

    \bigskip

    Since we know \textit{LIST.insert(...)} requires shifting of elements by $n - i = n - 0 = n$
    and \textit{LIST.pop(0)} requires shifting of $n - i - 1 = n - 1$ many elements,
    we can conclude both \textit{QUEUE.enqueue} and \textit{QUEUE.dequeue} takes
    longer time as size increases.

    \underline{\textbf{Notes:}}

    \bigskip

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Learned that the \textbf{front of queue} is where \textit{QUEUE.dequeue}
        occurs.

    \underline{\textbf{Stack 1:}}

    \bigskip

    \begin{align*}
        \text{Number of steps for \textit{s.push(1)}} + \text{Number of steps for \textit{s.pop()}} &= 1 + 1\\
        &= 2

    \end{align*}

    \item

    \underline{\textbf{Stack 1:}}

    \bigskip

    We need to determine the total number of steps taken in the code using \textit{Stack 1}.

    \bigskip

    First, we need to find the number of steps taken per iteration.

    \bigskip

    The code tells us there is only \textit{s.push(i)} in for loop.

    \bigskip

    Since we know the \textit{push} operation in \textit{Stack 1} takes 1 step,
    we can conclude 1 step is taken per iteration.

    \bigskip

    Finally, we need to determine the total number of steps taken.

    \bigskip

    Because we know the loop performs 5 iterations and each iteration takes 1 step,
    we can conclude the code takes total of

    \begin{align}
        5 \cdot 1 = 5
    \end{align}

    steps.

    First, we need to find the number of steps taken per iteration.

    \bigskip

    The code tells us there is only \textit{s.push(i)} in for loop.

    \bigskip

    Since we know the list in $s$ starts empty, and the size of list grows to $i$ at $i^{th}$
    iteration, we can conclude the size of list $n$ is $i$.

    \bigskip

    Since we know the \textit{push} operation in \textit{Stack 2} takes $n+1$ step,
    and since we know $n = i$, we can conclude $i+1$ step is taken per iteration.

    \bigskip

    Finally, we need to determine the total number of steps taken.

    \bigskip

    Because we know the loop starts at $i = 0$, ends at $i = 4$ with each iteration
    taking $i+1$ steps, we can conclude the code has total of

    \setcounter{equation}{0}
    \begin{align}
        \sum\limits_{i=0}^4 (i+1) &= \sum\limits_{i'=1}^5 i'\\
        &= \frac{5(5+1)}{2}\\
        &= \frac{30}{2}\\
        &= 15
