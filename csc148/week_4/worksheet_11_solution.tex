\section*{Question 1}
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item Here, the constant time means the running time of accessing and
    assigning element by index doesn't depend on the length of the list.

    \item

    \begin{align*}
        n -i
    \end{align*}

    many elements need to be shifted to right.

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Notes:}}

    \bigskip

    \begin{itemize}
        \item

        The following example tells us

        \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8 \linewidth]{images/worksheet_11_q1b_notes.png}
        \end{center}

        to position an element at index $i = 3$ of the list, $n - i = 6 - 3 = 3$
        elements must be moved over.

        \bigskip

        Using this fact, we can generalize that to position an element at index $i$
        of the list, $n - i$ many elements must be shifted.

        \item Learned that when items shifts, it shifts into the expansion room.

        \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8 \linewidth]{images/worksheet_11_q1b_notes2.png}
        \end{center}
    \end{itemize}

    \item Because we know the list size stays as is when an element is removed, we can
    conclude 0 many list elements must be moved.

        \underline{\textbf{Correct Solution:}}

        \color{red}
        The following example tells us

        \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/worksheet_11_q1c_correction.png}
        \end{center}

        when an element at index $i = 3$ is removed from the list $n - (i+1) =
        7 - (3 - 1) = 3$ many elements must be moved.

        \bigskip

        Using this fact, we can generalize that when an element is removed,
        $n - (i+1) = n - i - 1$ many elements must be shifted to left.

    \end{mdframed}

    \item

    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
        \item

        A solution is \textit{LIST.remove(...)}.

        \bigskip

        The answer to question 1.d tells us when an element is removed, $n-i$
        must be shifted to left.

        \bigskip

        Using this fact, we can write a list of smaller size needs to shift elements less.

        \bigskip

        Then, it follows from this fact that $n = 100$ works faster than $n = 1,000,000$.

        \item

        A solution is \textit{LIST.append(...)}

        \bigskip

        The definition of append tells us that upon call, an element is added to
        the end of a list, it takes a constant time to add an element
        as long as the expansion room is not filled.

        \bigskip

        It follows from this fact that $n = 100$ and $n = 1,000,000$ takes roughly
        the same amount of time.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item

    The definition of \textit{Queue} tells us \textit{Queue} is FIFO. That is,
    the first element inserted is the first to come out.

    \bigskip

    Since we know the front of \textit{Queue} is the front of the list, we
    can conclude \textit{LIST.insert(...)} and \textit{LIST.pop(0)} are used
    to support \textit{QUEUE.enqueue} and \textit{QUEUE.dequeue}, respectively.

    \bigskip

    Since we know \textit{LIST.insert(...)} requires shifting of elements by $n - i = n - 0 = n$
    and \textit{LIST.pop(0)} requires shifting of $n - i - 1 = n - 1$ many elements,
    we can conclude both \textit{QUEUE.enqueue} and \textit{QUEUE.dequeue} takes
    longer time as size increases.
