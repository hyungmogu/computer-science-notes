    \item What attribute stores the players of the game?

    \begin{itemize}
    \item The players of the game are stored in instance attribute \textit{players}.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    class NumberGame:
        ...
        def __init__(
            self,
            goal: int,
            min_step: int,
            max_step: int,
            players: Tuple[Player, Player]

            ...
            self.players = players # <- Here!
    \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}

    \item If \textit{turn} is 15, whose turn is it?

    \bigskip

    \begin{itemize}
        \item

        We need to determine who's turn is at turn 15.

        \bigskip

        The code of method \textit{whose\_turn} tells us

        \bigskip

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
        class NumberGame:
            ...
            def whose_turn(self, turn: int) -> Player:
                """Return the Player whose turn it is on the given turn number.
                """
                if turn % 2 == 0:
                    return self.players[0]
                else:
                    return self.players[1]
        \end{lstlisting}

        \bigskip

        Using this code, we can conclude that at turn 15, it's player 2's turn.

    \end{itemize}

    \item Write a line of code that would create an instance of \textit{NumberGame}
    that violates one of the representation invariants.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item

        We need write a line of code that violates one of the representational
        invariants.

        \bigskip

        The representational invariant of the initializer of

    \item Which of the representation invariants is it possible to violate by
    constructing a \textit{NumberGame} improperly?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item

        The following code tells us that the constructor of class \textit{NumberGame} has four
        representational invariants as parameter types

        \bigskip
