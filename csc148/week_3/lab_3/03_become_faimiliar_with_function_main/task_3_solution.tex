\section*{3) Become familiar with function \textit{main}}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item Where is a \textit{NumberGame} constructed?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item
        By observation, we can conclude a \textit{NumberGame} constructed
        inside function \textit{main}

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
        def main() -> None:
            ...
            while True:
                g = NumberGame(goal, minimum, maximum, (p1, p2)) #<- Here!!
                winner = g.play()
                print(f'And {winner} is the winner!!!')
                print(p1)
                print(p2)
                again = input('Again? (y/n) ')
                if again != 'y':
                    return

        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}

    \item This function calls \textit{g.play} repeatedly in a loop. What about the
    game can change each time \textit{g.play} is called: the goal, the min or max
    move, the players, the moves?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item

        By observation, we can conclude that

        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
            \item the goal doesn't change
            \item the min or max move don't change
            \item the current player change as a result of whose\_turn method.

            \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
            def play(self) -> str:
                ...
                while self.current < self.goal:
                    self.play_one_turn() # <- In here
                ...
                winner = self.whose_turn(self.turn - 1)
                return winner.namePlayers

            def play_one_turn(self) -> None:
                ...
                next_player = self.whose_turn(self.turn) # <- Here!!
                amount = next_player.move(
                    self.current,
                    self.min_step,
                    self.max_step,
                    self.goal
                )
                self.current += amount
                self.turn += 1

                print(f'{next_player.name} moves {amount}.')
                print(f'Total is now {self.current}.')


            def whose_turn(self, turn: int) -> Player:
                ...
                if turn % 2 == 0:
                    return self.players[0]
                else:
                    return self.players[1]

            \end{lstlisting}

            \item the move changes by the \textit{move} method in \textit{play\_one\_turn}.

            \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
                def play(self) -> str:
                    ...
                    while self.current < self.goal:
                        self.play_one_turn()
                    ...
                    winner = self.whose_turn(self.turn - 1)
                    return winner.namePlayers

                def play_one_turn(self) -> None:
                    ...
                    next_player = self.whose_turn(self.turn)
                    amount = next_player.move( # <- Here!!
                        self.current,
                        self.min_step,
                        self.max_step,
                        self.goal
                    )
                    self.current += amount
                    self.turn += 1

                    print(f'{next_player.name} moves {amount}.')
                    print(f'Total is now {self.current}.')

                \end{lstlisting}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

    \item List all the places in this function where a \textit{Player} is stored,
    an instance attribute of \textit{Player} is accessed or set, or a method is
    called on a \textit{Player}.

    \bigskip

    \begin{itemize}
        \item

        We need to find all places in this function where \textit{Player} is stored,
        where an instance attribute of \textit{Player} is accessed or set, or where
        a method is called on a \textit{Player}.

        \bigskip

        First, we need to find where \textit{Player} is stored in this function.

        \bigskip

        The code tells us the type of third argument in \textit{NumberGame}
        is Tuple, and each element in the tuple is taken by the variables \textit{p1}
        and \textit{p2}.

        \bigskip

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
        def main() -> None:
            ...
            while True:
                g = NumberGame(goal, minimum, maximum, (p1, p2)) # <- Here!!
                ...
        \end{lstlisting}

        \bigskip

        Because we know each element in the tuple is of type \textit{Player}, we can
        conclude \textit{Player} is stored inside variables \textit{p1} and
        \textit{p2}

        \bigskip

        Second, we need to find where the instance instance attribute of
        \textit{Player} is accessed or set in this function.

        \bigskip

        By observation, no instance attribute of \textit{Player} is accessed
        or set.

        \bigskip

        Finally, we need to find where a method of \textit{Player} is called
        in this function.

        \bigskip

        By observation, no method of \textit{Player} is accessed or set inside this function.
