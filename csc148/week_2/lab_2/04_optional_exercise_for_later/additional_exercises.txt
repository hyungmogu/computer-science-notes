Fraction
========

Context: a calculator app

We need to be able to multiply fractions, and the print them in their decimal
form. Fractions, of course have a numerator and a denominator. They need not be
in their simplest form, for example, we could have 8/2, or 6/8.


Player
======

Context: an app for a game like 2048 or PacMan, where players get a score each
time they play.

A player has a name and a history of the last 100 scores they've achieved in the
game. We need to keep track of new scores they get so we can determine their top
score and their average score on their most recent n games, where n is some
positive whole number.


Candyland Board
===============

Context: The Candyland board game

Candyland is a very simple children's game for two players. The board has spaces
from 0 to 100. On their turn, a player advances a certain number of spaces. The
first player to reach spot 100 wins. We need to keep track of where the players
are so that we can report on the location of the two players whenever needed.
We also want to be able to find out who the winner is: either one of the
players, both if it's a tie, or no one if the game isn't over yet.


Flight Roster
=============

Context: An airline reservation system

Each seat has a unique name, like "17C" and is either in business class or
economy. Passengers have booking IDs (a mix of letters and numbers). When they
book a seat, they request their preferred class (business or economy) and are
given any seat in that class. If the class is full, their booking is
unsuccessful. This airline gives passengers no choice about their specific seat.
We want to be able to report on how full a flight is: the percentage of seats
that are booked in economy, in business class, and overall.
