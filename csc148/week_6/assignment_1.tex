\section*{1) Get the starter code and read the documentation}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item Download the zip file that contains the starter code here a1.zip
    \item Unzip the file and place the contents in pycharm in your a1 folder (remember to set your a1 folder as a sources root)
    \item You should see the following files:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{course.py}
        \item \textit{criterion.py}
        \item \textit{grouper.py}
        \item \textit{survey.py}
        \item \textit{tests.py}
        \item \textit{example\_tests.py}
        \item \textit{example\_usage.py}
        \item \textit{example\_course.json}
        \item \textit{example\_survey.json}
    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\noindent For this assignment, you will be required to edit and submit the following files only:

\begin{itemize}
    \item course.py
    \item criterion.py
    \item grouper.py
    \item survey.py
    \item tests.py
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\noindent If you look at these files you will notice that you have been given the signature
and docstrings for all classes and methods. Read through these docstrings carefully;
they describe how you are expected to implement these classes and methods.

\bigskip

\subsection*{A picture!}

\noindent It might be difficult to imagine how all the classes defined in these files will
interact before you start writing the code itself. To help you out, here is a
diagram of all the classes you will be asked to contribute to for this assignment:

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8 \linewidth]{images/assignment_1/image_1.png}
\end{center}

\noindent Note that the attributes and methods shown in this diagram are only the ones
that we have given you in the starter code. You may need to define additional
private attributes or private helper methods.

\subsection*{Legend:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item dashed lines indicate a composition relationship between classes
    \item solid lines indicate an inheritance relationship between classes
    \item a solid circle around a group of classes indicates that there exists an inheritance relationship between these classes but it is not defined (you get to decide!)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\subsection*{Test your code!}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Try running the example\_tests.py file: all of the tests should fail because you haven’t written any code yet!
    \item Try running example\_usage.py file: you should get an error since you haven’t written any code yet!
    \item Open up the tests.py file: it is empty! This is where you will be writing all of your tests for this assignment
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Something to think about!}
Unlike A0, you will be submitting code split across multiple files. Open up each
of the files and look at which functions and classes are defined in each file. Why do you think the files were organized
in this way? Is there a different way we could have organized these files?

\section*{2) Complete the Student Class}
The Student class represents a student who can be enrolled in a university
course.

\bigskip

\noindent The starter code for the \textit{Student} class can be found in \textit{course.py}. Open up this
file and read through the docstrings for each of the the \textit{Student} class’s methods.
Then, implement each of the methods in the \textit{Student} class.

\bigskip

\noindent Remember: you may need to define additional private attributes or
private helper methods!

\bigskip

\subsection*{Test your code!}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write at least one unit test for each method in \textit{Student}. You are not
    required to write tests for initializers.
    \item You should write these tests in the \textit{tests.py} file.
    \item Once you have finished writing these tests, run all the tests in \textit{test.py}.
    Make sure your code passes all your tests before moving on.
    \item Run the tests in \textit{example\_tests.py}, the tests in the \textit{TestStudent} class should now pass.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\subsection*{Something to think about!}
The \textit{Student.has\_answer} method asks you to check if a student has a
valid answer to a given question. Do we have a way to determine if an answer is
valid or not yet? Answer: no and we won’t until we complete step 4. You may need
to come back and finish this method after completing step 5.

\section*{3) Complete the Course Class}
The \textit{Course} class represents a university course.

\bigskip

\noindent The starter code for the \textit{Course} class can be found in \textit{course.py}. Open up this
file and read through the docstrings for each of the the \textit{Course} class’s methods.
Then, implement each of the methods in the \textit{Course} class. You may find the
function \textit{sort\_students} helpful.

\bigskip

\noindent Remember: you may need to define additional private attributes or
private helper methods!

\subsection*{Test your code!}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write at least one unit test for each method in \textit{Course}. You are not
    required to write tests for initializers.
    \item You should write these tests in the \textit{tests.py} file.
    \item Once you have finished writing these tests, run all the tests in
    \textit{test.py}. Make sure your code passes all your tests before moving on.
    \item Run the tests in \textit{example\_tests.py}, the tests in the \textit{TestCourse} class
    should now pass.
    \item Something to think about!
    \item The \textit{Course.all\_answered} method asks you to check if all students have
    a valid answer for every question in a \textit{Survey}. Which steps do you need to
    complete before you can finish this method? You may have to come back later to
    finish the \textit{Course.all\_answered} method.
\end{itemize}

\section*{4) Complete the Question Classes}
The file \textit{survey.py} contains an abstract \textit{Question} class, and the following classes
for representing different types of questions that you might find on a survey:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Question
    \item MultipleChoiceQuestion
    \item NumericQuestion
    \item YesNoQuestion
    \item CheckboxQuestion
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\noindent As well as defining the text of the question itself, these classes also specify
what are valid answers to these questions.

\bigskip

\noindent Open up \textit{survey.py} and read through the docstrings for the methods in
these question classes.

\bigskip

You might notice that we have not defined any inheritance hierarchy between these
classes. You get to decide what it should be. However, in doing so you must follow
these rules:

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item The abstract Question class should not inherit from any class other than
    object.
    \item All other \textit{Question} classes should inherit from the abstract
    \textit{Question} class either directly or indirectly.
    \item At least one non-abstract \textit{Question} class should inherit from another
    non-abstract Question class.
    \item There are many possible inheritance structures you could choose.
    Remember that one of the requirements for this assignment is to avoid
    writing duplicate code. Think about which sort of inheritance structure
    best lets you avoid duplicate code.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\noindent Implement each of the methods in the Question classes. You may remove a method
that we included in the starter code for a child class if you wish to simply
inherit the parent’s method rather than to override it.

\noindent Remember: you may need to define additional private attributes or
private helper methods!

\subsection*{Test your code!}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write at least one unit test for each method in each of the Question classes. You
    do not need to write tests for abstract methods or initializers but you do need
    to write tests for inherited methods.
    \item For example, even if you structure your code so that a child class inherits its
    \textit{validate\_answer} method without modification from the parent class, you still need
    to write separate tests for the \textit{validate\_answer} method in the parent
    class and the child class.
    \item You should write these tests in the \textit{tests.py} file.
    \item Once you have finished writing these tests, run all the tests in \textit{test.py}.
    Make sure your code passes all your tests before moving on.
    \item Run the tests in \textit{example\_tests.py}, the tests in the
    \textit{TestMultipleChoiceQuestion},\\ \textit{TestNumericQuestion},
    \textit{TestYesNoQuestion}, and \textit{TestCheckboxQuestion} class should now pass.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Something to think about!}
The \textit{validate\_answer} methods ask you to check if an answer is a valid answer for
this question. Do we have a enough information about the \textit{Answer} class
in order to complete this method now? You may need to come back and finish this
method after completing step 4.

\bigskip

\section*{5) Complete the Answer Class}
The \textit{Answer} class represents an answer to one of the questions you wrote
classes for in Step 3.

\bigskip

\noindent The starter code for the \textit{Answer} class can be found in \textit{survey.py}.
Open up this file and read through the docstrings for each of the the \textit{Answer}
class’s methods. Then, implement each of the methods in the \textit{Answer} class.

\bigskip

\noindent Remember: you may need to define additional private attributes or
private helper methods!

\bigskip

If you have not implemented the \textit{validate\_answer} methods in the \textit{Question}
classes, the \textit{Course.all\_answered} and the \textit{Student.has\_answer}
methods yet, go back and finish them now.

\bigskip

\subsection*{Test your code!}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write at least one unit test for each method in \textit{Answer}. You are not required to write tests for initializers.
    \item You should write these tests in the \textit{tests.py} file.
    \item Once you have finished writing these tests, run all the tests in
    \textit{test.py}. Make sure your code passes all your tests before moving on.
    \item Run the tests in \textit{example\_tests.py}, the tests in the \textit{TestAnswer}
    class should now pass.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Something to think about!}
The \textit{Answer} class is one of the simplest classes that we will implement
in this assignment. What is the advantage of creating such a simple class? Are
there any disadvantages?
