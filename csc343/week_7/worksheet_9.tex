\begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item \textbf{Exercise 11.1.1:} Since there is no schema to design in the semistructured-data model,
    we cannot ask you design schemas to describe different situations. Rahter,
    in the following exercises we shall ask you to suggest how particular data
    might be organized to reflect certan facts.

    \bigskip

    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
        \item Add to Fig. 1 the facts that \textit{Star Wars} was directed by
        George Lucas and produced by Gary Kurtz
        \item Add to Fig. 1 information about \textit{Empire Strikes Back} and
        \textit{Return of the Jedi}, including the factds that Carrie Fisher and
        Mark Hamill appeared in these movies
        \item Add to (b) information about the studio (Fox) for these movies and
        the address of the studio (Hollywood).
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Exercise 11.1.2:} Suggest how typical data about banks and customers,
    as in Exercise 4.1.1, could be represented in the semistructured model

    \item \textbf{Exercise 11.1.4:} Suggest how typical data about genealogy, as was
    described in Exercise 4.1.6, could be represented in the semistructured model

    \item \textbf{Exercise 11.1.5:} UML and the semistructured-data model are both "graphical"
    in nature, in the sense that they use nodes, labels, and connections among
    nodes as the medium of expression. Yet there is an essential difference between
    the two models. What is it?
