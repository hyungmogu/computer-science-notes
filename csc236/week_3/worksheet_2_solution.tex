\section*{Question 1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Statement:}} Any full binary tree with at least 1 node has
    more leaves than internal nodes.

    \bigskip

        \underline{\textbf{Rough Work:}}

        \bigskip

        Let $n$ be the total number of nodes in a full binary tree.

        \bigskip

        We will prove the statement by complete induction on $n$.

        \bigskip

        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
            \item Base Case ($n = 1$)

            \begin{mdframed}

            Let $n = 1$.

            \bigskip

            We need to prove the full binary tree with 1 total number of nodes
            has more leaves than internal nodes.

            \bigskip

            The definition of leaf tells us that a node that has no children
            is a leaf.

            \bigskip

            Since the full binary tree with 1 node has no children, we
            can conclude the node is a leaf.

            \bigskip

            Using this fact, we can write the full binary tree has 1 leaf.

            \bigskip

            Now, the definition of an internal node tells us that a node is
            an internal node if it is not a leaf.

            \bigskip

            Since there is 1 leaf and 1 total node in the full binary tree,
            we can write there is 0 internal node.

            \bigskip

            So, since there is 1 leaf node and 0 internal node, we can
            conclude the full binary tree has more leaves than internal nodes.

            \end{mdframed}

            \item Base Case ($n = 2$)

            \begin{mdframed}

            Let $n = 2$.

            \bigskip

            We need to prove the full binary tree with 2 total number of nodes
            has more leaves than internal nodes.

            \bigskip

            The definition of full binary tree tells us that a binary tree is a full
            binary tree if every internal node has two children.

            \bigskip

            Since we know by observation that the tree with 2 total number of nodes
            has 1 leaf and 1 internal node, using above fact, we can write the
            tree is not a full binary tree.

            \bigskip

            Then, by vacuous truth, we can conclude the tree has more leaves than
            internal nodes.
            \end{mdframed}

            \item Base Case ($n = 3$)

            Let $n = 3$.

            \bigskip

            We need to prove the full binary tree with 3 total number of nodes
            has more leaves than internal nodes.

            \begin{enumerate}[1.]
                \item Show the three forms a full binary tree
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item State the definition of full binary tree

                    \begin{mdframed}
                    The definition of full binary tree tells us that a binary tree is a full
                    binary tree if every internal node has two children.
                    \end{mdframed}

                    \item Show that with 3 as the total number of nodes, the only full binary
                    tree that can be formed is 1 internal node and 2 children.

                    \begin{mdframed}
                    Because we know there are two types of binary trees possible,
                    one is the tree with 2 internal nodes and 1 child and the other
                    is 1 internal node and 2 children, using above fact, we can write
                    the only possible full binary tree with 3 total nodes is 1 internal
                    node and 2 children.
                    \end{mdframed}

                    \item Conclude that the children are leaves, and there are more
                    leaves than internal nodes

                    \begin{mdframed}
                    Now, the definition of leaf tells us leaf is a node that has no children.

                    \bigskip

                    Because we know by observation that the 2 child nodes don't
                    have children, we can write the full binary tree has 2 leaves.

                    \bigskip

                    So, because we know the full binary tree has 1 internal node
                    and 2 leaves, we can conclude the full binary tree has more
                    leaves than internal node.
                    \end{mdframed}
                \end{itemize}

                \bigskip

                \begin{mdframed}

                \underline{\textbf{Base Case ($n = 3$):}}

                \bigskip

                Let $n = 3$.

                \bigskip

                We need to prove the full binary tree with 3 total number of nodes
                has more leaves than internal nodes.

                \bigskip

                Because we know there are two types of binary trees possible,
                one is the tree with 2 internal nodes and 1 child and the other
                is 1 internal node and 2 children, using above fact, we can write
                the only possible full binary tree with 3 total nodes is 1 internal
                node and 2 children.

                \bigskip

                Now, the definition of leaf tells us leaf is a node that has no children.

                \bigskip

                Because we know by observation that the 2 child nodes don't
                have children, we can write the full binary tree has 2 leaves.

                \bigskip

                So, because we know the full binary tree has 1 internal node
                and 2 leaves, we can conclude the full binary tree has more
                leaves than internal node.

        \item Complete Induction

            \item \underline{\textbf{Statement Alt.:}} $\Bigl(\forall n \in \mathbb{N},\:\Bigl[ \ \bigwedge\limits_{k = 0}^{k=n-1} P(k) \Bigr] \Rightarrow P(n) \Bigr) \Rightarrow \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, P(n)$

                \underline{\textbf{Statement:}} $\forall n \in \mathbb{N},\:n \geq 0 \Rightarrow 10 \mid (n^5 - n)$

                \bigskip

                We will prove the statement by strong induction on $n$.

                \begin{enumerate}[1.]
                    \item Base Case ($n = 0$)

                    \begin{mdframed}

                    Let $n = 0$.

                    \bigskip

                    We need to prove $10 \mid (n^5 - n)$ is true when $n = 0$. That is,
                    there exists $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(n^5 - n) = 10k$.

                    \bigskip

                    Let $k = 0$.

                    \bigskip

                    Starting from the left hand side, using the fact $n = 0$,
                    we can write

                    \begin{align}
                        (n^5 - n) = 0
                    \end{align}

                    \bigskip

                    Then, because we know $10k = 0$, we can conclude

                    \begin{align}
                        (n^5 - n) = 10k
                    \end{align}

                    \end{mdframed}

                    \item Base Case ($n = 1$)

                    \begin{mdframed}

                    Let $n = 1$.

                    \bigskip

                    We need to prove $10 \mid (n^5 - n)$ is true when $n = 1$. That is,
                    there exists $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(n^5 - n) = 10k$.

                    \bigskip

                    Let $k = 0$.

                    \bigskip

                    Starting from the left hand side, using the fact $n = 0$,
                    we can write

                    \begin{align}
                        (n^5 - n) &= 1 - 1\\
                        &= 0
                    \end{align}

                    \bigskip

                    Then, because we know $10k = 0$, we can conclude

                    \begin{align}
                        (n^5 - n) = 10k
                    \end{align}

                    \end{mdframed}

                    \item Inductive Step

                    \begin{mdframed}

                    Assume $k \geq 1$. Assume that for all natural number $i$ satisfying $0 \leq i \leq k$, $10 \mid (i^5 - i)$.
                    That is, $\exists d \in \mathbb{Z},\:(i^5 - i) = 10d$.

                    \bigskip

                    We need to prove $\exists \tilde{d} \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
                    $((k+1)^5 - (k+1)) = 10 \tilde{d}$.

                    \bigskip

                    Let $\tilde{d} = c + (k-1)^4 + 4 \cdot (k-1)^3 + 8 \cdot (k-1)^2 +
                    8 \cdot(k-1) + 3$.

                    \bigskip

                    Starting from $((k+1)^5 - (k+1))$, using binominal theorem, we can write,

                    \begin{align}
                        (k+1)^5 - (k+1) &= \Bigl[ (k-1) + 2 \Bigr]^5 - \Bigl[ (k-1) + 2 \Bigr]\\
                        &= \sum\limits_{b=0}^5 \binom{5}{b} (k-1)^{5-b} \cdot 2^b\\
                        \begin{split}
                        &= (k-1)^5 + 10 \cdot (k-1)^4 + 40 \cdot (k-1)^3 + \\
                        & 80 \cdot (k-1)^2 + 80 \cdot(k-1) + 32 - \Bigl[ (k-1) + 2 \Bigr] \\
                        \end{split}\\
                        \begin{split}
                        &= \Bigl[ (k-1)^5 - (k-1) \Bigr] + 10 \cdot (k-1)^4 + \\
                        & 40 \cdot (k-1)^3 + 80 \cdot (k-1)^2 + 80 \cdot(k-1) + 30
                        \end{split}
                    \end{align}

                    (The reason why $k-1$ is chosen instead of $k-2$ and $k-3$ is
                    because of the last term $2^5 = 32$, i.e $32 -2 = 30$)

                    \bigskip

                    Then, because we know $0 \leq k - 1 \leq k$ and $10 \mid (k-1)^5 - (k-1)$
                    from the header, we can write $\exists c \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
                    $(k-1)^5 - (k-1) = 10c$, and

                    \begin{align}
                        \begin{split}
                        (k+1)^5 - (k+1) &= 10c + 10 \cdot (k-1)^4 + 40 \cdot (k-1)^3 + \\
                        & 80 \cdot (k-1)^2 + 80 \cdot(k-1) + 30
                        \end{split}\\
                        \begin{split}
                        (k+1)^5 - (k+1) &= 10 \cdot \Bigl[c +\cdot (k-1)^4 + 4 \cdot (k-1)^3 + \\
                        & 8 \cdot (k-1)^2 + 8 \cdot(k-1) + 3\Bigr]
                        \end{split}\\
                    \end{align}

                    \bigskip

                    Then, because we know $\tilde{d} = c + (k-1)^4 + 4 \cdot (k-1)^3 + 8 \cdot (k-1)^2 +
                    8 \cdot(k-1) + 3$ from the header, we can conclude

                    \begin{align}
                        (k+1)^5 - (k+1) &= 10 \tilde{d}
                    \end{align}

                    \end{mdframed}
                \end{enumerate}
