\section*{Question 1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Statement:}} Any full binary tree with at least 1 node has
    more leaves than internal nodes.

    \bigskip

    \begin{proof}
    Let $n$ be the total number of nodes in a full binary tree.

    \bigskip

    We will prove the statement by complete induction on $n$.

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Base Case ($n = 1$):}}

    \bigskip

    Let $n = 1$.

    \bigskip

    We need to prove the full binary tree with 1 total number of nodes
    has more leaves than internal nodes.

    \bigskip

    There is only one full binary tree exists with 1 total number of node. That is,
    the full binary tree with 1 child node and 0 internal nodes.

    \bigskip

    Then, since we know a node is a leaf if it has no children, and since we know
    the child node has 0 children, we can write the child node is a leaf node.

    \bigskip

    Then, because we know the full binary tree has 1 leaf node, and 0 internal node,
    we can conclude it has more leaves than internal nodes.

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Base Case ($n = 2$):}}

    \bigskip

    Let $n = 2$.

    \bigskip

    We need to prove the full binary tree with 2 total number of nodes
    has more leaves than internal nodes.

    \bigskip

    The definition of full binary tree tells us that a binary tree is a full
    binary tree if every internal node has two children.

    \bigskip

    Since we know the tree with 2 total number of nodes
    has 1 leaf and 1 internal node, using above fact, we can write the
    tree is not a full binary tree.

    \bigskip

    Then, by vacuous truth, we can conclude the tree has more leaves than
    internal nodes.

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Base Case ($n = 3$):}}

    \bigskip

    Let $n = 3$.

    \bigskip

    We need to prove the full binary tree with 3 total number of nodes
    has more leaves than internal nodes.

    \bigskip

    The definition of full binary tree tells us that a binary tree is a full
    binary tree if every internal node has two children.

    \bigskip

    Because we know there are two types of binary trees possible,
    one is the tree with 2 internal nodes and 1 child and the other
    is 1 internal node and 2 children, using above fact, we can write
    the only possible full binary tree with 3 total nodes is 1 internal
    node and 2 children.

    \bigskip

    Now, the definition of leaf tells us leaf is a node that has no children.

    \bigskip

    Because we know by observation that the 2 child nodes don't
    have children, we can write the full binary tree has 2 leaves.

    \bigskip

    So, because we know the full binary tree has 1 internal node
    and 2 leaves, we can conclude the full binary tree has more
    leaves than internal node.

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Inductive Step:}}

    \bigskip

    Let $k \geq 1$ be an arbitrary natural number. Assume that for all natural
    number $i$ satisfying $1 \leq i \leq k$, any full binary trees with $i$
    total number of nodes has more leaves than internal nodes.

    \bigskip

    Let $T$ be an arbitrary full binary tree with $k+1$ nodes. Let $T'$
    be the binary tree obtained by removing 2 leaves from the same parent
    node.


    \bigskip

    Let $\ell$ be the number of leaves of $T$, and $m$ be the number of
    internal nodes of $T$. Similarly, let $\ell'$ be the number of leaves of
    $T'$ and $m'$ be the number of internal nodes of $T'$. We must prove
    $l > m$.

    \bigskip

    First, we need to show $\ell' > m'$.

    \bigskip

    The header tells us that $T'$ is a full binary tree as a result
    of removing 2 leaves from the parent node of $T$.

    \bigskip

    Using this fact, we can calculate $T'$ has
    \setcounter{equation}{0}
    \begin{align}
        k+1-2 = k-1
    \end{align}

    nodes.

    \bigskip

    Then, because we know $1 \leq k-1 \leq k$, using induction hypothesis,
    we can write

    \begin{align}
        \ell' > m'
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Second, we need to show $\ell = \ell' + 1$ and $m = m' + 1$.

    \bigskip

    The total number of both the leaf nodes and the internal
    nodes increase by 1 when 2 nodes are added to the same leaf node
    in a full binary tree.

    \bigskip

    Since 2 nodes added to the same leaf node of $T'$ is $T$, we can
    write $\ell = \ell' + 1$ and $m = m' + 1$.

    \bigskip

    Finally, putting together, because we know $\ell' > m'$, $\ell = \ell' + 1$
    and $m = m' + 1$, we can conclude

    \begin{align}
        \ell' + 1 &> m' + 1\\
        \ell &> m
    \end{align}


    \end{proof}

    %         be the binary tree obtained by removing 2 leaves from the same parent
    %         node.


    %         \bigskip

    %         Let $\ell$ be the number of leaves of $T$, and $m$ be the number of
    %         internal nodes of $T$. Similarly, let $\ell'$ be the number of leaves of
    %         $T'$ and $m'$ be the number of internal nodes of $T'$. We must prove
    %         $l > m$.

    %         \bigskip

    %         First, we need to show $\ell' > m'$.

    %         \bigskip

    %         The header tells us that $T'$ is a full binary tree as a result
    %         of removing 2 leaves from the parent node of $T$.

    %         \bigskip

    %         Using this fact, we can calculate $T'$ has
    %         \setcounter{equation}{0}
    %         \begin{align}
    %             k+1-2 = k-1
    %         \end{align}

    %         nodes.

    %         \bigskip

    %         Then, because we know $1 \leq k-1 \leq k$, using induction hypothesis,
    %         we can write

    %         \begin{align}
    %             \ell' > m'
    %         \end{align}

    %         \bigskip

    %         Second, we need to show $\ell = \ell' + 1$ and $m = m' + 1$.

    %         \bigskip

    %         The total number of both the leaf nodes and the internal
    %         nodes increase by 1 when 2 nodes are added to the same leaf node
    %         in a full binary tree.

    %         \bigskip

    %         Since 2 nodes added to the same leaf node of $T'$ is $T$, we can
    %         write $\ell = \ell' + 1$ and $m = m' + 1$.

    %         \bigskip

    %         Finally, putting together, because we know $\ell' > m'$, $\ell = \ell' + 1$
    %         and $m = m' + 1$, we can conclude

    %         \begin{align}
    %             \ell' + 1 &> m' + 1\\
    %             \ell &> m
    %         \end{align}

                \bigskip

                We will prove the statement by strong induction on $n$.

                \begin{enumerate}[1.]
                    \item Base Case ($n = 0$)

                    \begin{mdframed}

                    Let $n = 0$.

                    \bigskip

                    We need to prove $10 \mid (n^5 - n)$ is true when $n = 0$. That is,
                    there exists $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(n^5 - n) = 10k$.

                    \bigskip

                    Let $k = 0$.

                    \bigskip

                    Starting from the left hand side, using the fact $n = 0$,
                    we can write

                    \begin{align}
                        (n^5 - n) = 0
                    \end{align}

                    \bigskip

                    Then, because we know $10k = 0$, we can conclude

                    \begin{align}
                        (n^5 - n) = 10k
                    \end{align}

                    \end{mdframed}

                    \item Base Case ($n = 1$)

                    \begin{mdframed}

                    Let $n = 1$.

                    \bigskip

                    We need to prove $10 \mid (n^5 - n)$ is true when $n = 1$. That is,
                    there exists $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(n^5 - n) = 10k$.

                    \bigskip

                    Let $k = 0$.

                    \bigskip

                    Starting from the left hand side, using the fact $n = 0$,
                    we can write

                    \begin{align}
                        (n^5 - n) &= 1 - 1\\
                        &= 0
                    \end{align}

                    \bigskip

                    Then, because we know $10k = 0$, we can conclude

                    \begin{align}
                        (n^5 - n) = 10k

                    \item Inductive Step

                    \begin{mdframed}

                    Assume $k \geq 1$. Assume that for all natural number $i$ satisfying $0 \leq i \leq k$, $10 \mid (i^5 - i)$.
                    That is, $\exists d \in \mathbb{Z},\:(i^5 - i) = 10d$.

                    \bigskip

                    We need to prove $\exists \tilde{d} \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
                    $((k+1)^5 - (k+1)) = 10 \tilde{d}$.

                    \bigskip

                    Let $\tilde{d} = c + (k-1)^4 + 4 \cdot (k-1)^3 + 8 \cdot (k-1)^2 +
                    8 \cdot(k-1) + 3$.

                    \bigskip

                    Starting from $((k+1)^5 - (k+1))$, using binominal theorem, we can write,

                    \begin{align}
                        (k+1)^5 - (k+1) &= \Bigl[ (k-1) + 2 \Bigr]^5 - \Bigl[ (k-1) + 2 \Bigr]\\
                        &= \sum\limits_{b=0}^5 \binom{5}{b} (k-1)^{5-b} \cdot 2^b\\
                        \begin{split}
                        &= (k-1)^5 + 10 \cdot (k-1)^4 + 40 \cdot (k-1)^3 + \\
                        & 80 \cdot (k-1)^2 + 80 \cdot(k-1) + 32 - \Bigl[ (k-1) + 2 \Bigr] \\
                        \end{split}\\
                        \begin{split}
                        &= \Bigl[ (k-1)^5 - (k-1) \Bigr] + 10 \cdot (k-1)^4 + \\
                        & 40 \cdot (k-1)^3 + 80 \cdot (k-1)^2 + 80 \cdot(k-1) + 30
                        \end{split}
                    \end{align}

                    (The reason why $k-1$ is chosen instead of $k-2$ and $k-3$ is
                    because of the last term $2^5 = 32$, i.e $32 -2 = 30$)

                    \bigskip

                    Then, because we know $0 \leq k - 1 \leq k$ and $10 \mid (k-1)^5 - (k-1)$
                    from the header, we can write $\exists c \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
                    $(k-1)^5 - (k-1) = 10c$, and

                    \begin{align}
                        \begin{split}
                        (k+1)^5 - (k+1) &= 10c + 10 \cdot (k-1)^4 + 40 \cdot (k-1)^3 + \\
                        & 80 \cdot (k-1)^2 + 80 \cdot(k-1) + 30
                        \end{split}\\
                        \begin{split}
                        (k+1)^5 - (k+1) &= 10 \cdot \Bigl[c +\cdot (k-1)^4 + 4 \cdot (k-1)^3 + \\
                        & 8 \cdot (k-1)^2 + 8 \cdot(k-1) + 3\Bigr]
                        \end{split}\\
                    \end{align}

                    \bigskip

                    Then, because we know $\tilde{d} = c + (k-1)^4 + 4 \cdot (k-1)^3 + 8 \cdot (k-1)^2 +
                    8 \cdot(k-1) + 3$ from the header, we can conclude

                    \begin{align}
                        (k+1)^5 - (k+1) &= 10 \tilde{d}
                    \end{align}

                    \end{mdframed}
