\section*{Question 1}
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item

    In this case assume that $n \leq 1$.

    \bigskip

    We want to show $n \leq 1$.

    \bigskip

    Since the assumption tells us $n \leq 1$, we can conclude this is true.

    \item

    \begin{proof}

    Let $a = d$ and $b = k$. Assume there exists $d \in \mathbb{N}$ where
    $(\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, n = dk) \land d \neq 1 \land d \neq n$. Assume $n > 1$

    \bigskip

    We need to prove that $n \nmid a$, $n \nmid b$ and $n \mid ab$.

    \bigskip

    We will do so in parts.

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Part 1 (Proving $n \nmid a$):}}

    \bigskip

    We need to prove $n \nmid a$.

    \bigskip

    First, we need to show $n \geq d$.

    \bigskip

    The fact 2 tells us

    \begin{align}
        \forall x,y \in \mathbb{N}, y \geq 1 \land x \mid y \Rightarrow 1 \leq x \leq y
    \end{align}

    and we know from headers that $d \mid n$, $n > 1$, and $n,d \in \mathbb{N}$.

    \bigskip

    Then, by using these facts, we can write

    \begin{align}
        1 \leq d \leq n
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Second, we need to show $n = d$.

    \bigskip

    The definition of divisibility tells us for $n$ to
    divide $d$, there must be some $k_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
    $d$ is equal to $k_1 \cdot n$.

    \bigskip

    Then, since we know $n \geq d$, by using these facts, we can conclude
    the definition of divisibility is satisfied only when $k_1 = 1$, or
    when $n = d$.

    \bigskip

    Finally, since we know from the header that $n \neq d$, we can conclude
    $n \nmid d$.

    \bigskip

    Then, since we know $d = a$ from the header, we can conclude $n \nmid a$.

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Part 2 (Proving $n \nmid b$):}}

    \bigskip

    We need to prove $n \nmid b$.

    \bigskip

    First, we need to show $k \mid n$.

    \bigskip

    The assumption tells us $n = kd$.

    \bigskip

    Then, it follows from the definition of divisibility that $k \mid d$.

    \bigskip

    Second, we need to show $k \geq 1$.

    \bigskip

    The header tells us $n > 1$ $d \geq 0$, and we know from
    assumption that $n = dk$.

    \bigskip

    Since the facts tell us $k \leq 0$ results in $n \leq 0$ and this
    cannot happen, we can conclude $k \geq 1$.

    \bigskip

    Third, we need to show $n \geq k$ using the fact $k \geq 1$ and $k \mid n$.

    \bigskip

    The fact 2 tells us

    \begin{align}
        \forall x,y \in \mathbb{N}, y \geq 1 \land x \mid y \Rightarrow 1 \leq x \leq y
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Since we know $k \mid n$, $n > 1$ and $k,n \in \mathbb{N}$, we can conclude
    $k \leq n$.

    \bigskip

    Fourth, we need to show $n = k$.

    \bigskip

    The definition of divisibility tells us for $n$ to
    divide $k$, there must be some $k_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
    $k$ is equal to $k_1 \cdot n$.

    \bigskip

    Then, using the fact $n \geq k$, we can conclude the definition of
    divisibility is satisfied only when $k_1 = 1$, or $n = k$.

    \bigskip

    Finally, since we know from the header that $n \neq k$, we can conclude
    $n \nmid k$.

    \bigskip

    Then, it follows from the fact $k = b$, we can conclude $n \nmid b$.

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Part 3 (Proving $n \mid ab$):}}

    \bigskip

    We need to prove $n \mid ab$.

    \bigskip

    The fact 1 tells us

    \begin{align}
        \forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x \mid x
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Since we know $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we can conclude $n \mid n$.

    \bigskip

    Then, since we know $n = dk$, $d = a$ and $k = b$, we can conclude
    $n \mid ab$.

    \end{proof}

    \bigskip

    \begin{mdframed}

    \underline{\textbf{Pseudoproof:}}

    \bigskip

    Let $a = d$ and $b = k$. Assume there exists $d \in \mathbb{N}$ where
    $(\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, n = dk) \land d \neq 1 \land d \neq n$. Assume $n > 1$

    \bigskip

    We need to prove that $n \nmid a$, $n \nmid b$ and $n \mid ab$.

    \bigskip

    We will do so in parts.

    \bigskip

    \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item Show $n \nmid a$.

        \bigskip

        First, we need to show $n \nmid a$.

        \bigskip

        \begin{enumerate}[1.]

            \item Show $n \geq d$.

            \bigskip

            \begin{mdframed}
            The fact 2 tells us

            \begin{align}
                \forall x,y \in \mathbb{N}, y \geq 1 \land x \mid y \Rightarrow 1 \leq x \leq y
            \end{align}

            and we know from headers that $d \mid n$, $n > 1$, and $n,d \in \mathbb{N}$.

            \bigskip

            Then, by using these facts, we can write

            \begin{align}
                1 \leq d \leq n
            \end{align}

            \end{mdframed}

            \item Show that for $n$ to divide $d$, $n = d$.

            \begin{mdframed}
            Now, the definition of divisibility tells us for $n$ to
            divide $d$, there must be some $k_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
            $d$ is equal to $k_1 \cdot n$.

            \bigskip

            Then, since we know $n \geq d$, by using these facts, we can conclude
            the definition of divisibility is satisfied when $k_1 = 1$, or
            when $n = d$.

            \end{mdframed}

            \item Conclude $n \nmid a$.

            \begin{mdframed}
            Then, since we know from header that $n \neq d$, we can conclude
            $n \nmid d$.

        \end{enumerate}

        We need to prove $n \nmid a$.

        \end{align}

        and we know from headers that $d \mid n$, $n > 1$, and $n,d \in \mathbb{N}$.

        \bigskip

        Then, by using these facts, we can write

        \begin{align}
            1 \leq d \leq n
        \end{align}

        \bigskip

        Second, we need to show $n = d$.

        \bigskip

        The definition of divisibility tells us for $n$ to
        divide $d$, there must be some $k_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
        $d$ is equal to $k_1 \cdot n$.

        \bigskip

        Then, since we know $n \geq d$, by using these facts, we can conclude
        the definition of divisibility is satisfied only when $k_1 = 1$, or
        when $n = d$.

        \bigskip

        Finally, since we know from the header that $n \neq d$, we can conclude
        $n \nmid d$.

        \bigskip

        Then, since we know $d = a$ from the header, we can conclude $n \nmid a$.

    \textbf{Notes:}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Made some serious errors (i.e. show n = a or n = b) :(.
        \item How can a proof be organized so it's structurally clear so moe
        3 months from now can say I understand this proof? I used first, second
        and third to show steps involved but I still feel something is missing...
        \item Can I write a predicate logic for proving $n \nmid b$ or $n \nmid a$?
        (i.e. ... $\Rightarrow n \nmid b$)?
