\section*{Question 1}
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item

    Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

    \bigskip

    Here, the minimum possible change occurs for the loop variable in a single
    iteration when $i = i + 1$.

    \bigskip

    The maximum possible change occurs for the loop variable in a single
    iteration when $i = i + 6$.

    \bigskip

    The exact upper bound of the variable after k iteration is

    \begin{align}
        i_k &\leq 6k
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    The exact lower bound of the variable after k iteration is

    \begin{align}
        k &\leq i_k
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Using the fact that the termination occurs when $i_k = n$, we can calculate
    that for the upper bound, the loop terminates when

    \begin{align}
        6k &\geq n\\
        k &\geq \frac{n}{6}
    \end{align}

    Because we know $\frac{n}{6}$ may be a decimal, we can conclude the closest value at
    which the loop terminates is when

    \begin{align}
        k &= \left\lceil \frac{n}{6} \right\rceil
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Using the same fact, we can calculate that for the lower bound, the loop
    terminates when

    \begin{align}
        k &\geq n
    \end{align}

    It follows from above that for the lower bound, the smallest value of $k$ at which
    the loop termination occurs is when

    \begin{align}
        k &= n
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Then, we can conclude the function has asymptotic lower bound of $\Omega(n)$, and
    asymptotic upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(n)$.

    \bigskip

    Then, since both $\Omega$ and $\mathcal{O}$ have the same value, $\Theta(n)$
    is also true.

        \underline{\textbf{Correct Solution:}}

        \bigskip

        Here, the minimum possible change occurs for the loop variable in a single
        iteration when $i = i + 1$.

        \bigskip

        The maximum possible change occurs for the loop variable in a single
        iteration when $i = i + 6$.

        \bigskip

        The exact upper bound of the variable after k iteration is

        \begin{align}
            i_k &\leq 6k
        \end{align}

        \bigskip

        The exact lower bound of the variable after k iteration is

        \begin{align}
            k &\leq i_k
        \end{align}

        \bigskip

        Using the fact that the termination occurs when $i_k = n$, we can calculate
        that for the upper bound, the loop terminates when

        \begin{align}
            6k &\geq n\\
            k &\geq \frac{n}{6}
        \end{align}

        Because we know $\frac{n}{6}$ may be a decimal, we can conclude the closest value at
        which the loop terminates is when

        \begin{align}
            k &= \left\lceil \frac{n}{6} \right\rceil \color{red}+1\color{black}
        \end{align}

        \bigskip

        Using the same fact, we can calculate that for the lower bound, the loop
        terminates when

        \begin{align}
            k &\geq n
        \end{align}

        It follows from above that for the lower bound, the smallest value of $k$ at which
        the loop termination occurs is when

        \begin{align}
            k &= n \color{red}+1\color{black}
        \end{align}

        \bigskip

        Then, we can conclude the function has asymptotic lower bound of $\Omega(n)$, and
        asymptotic upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(n)$.

        \bigskip

        Since both $\Omega$ and $\mathcal{O}$ have the same value, $\Theta(n)$
        is also true.

    \textbf{Notes:}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item where is \textbf{+1} coming from? Is it coming from the loop variable $i = 0$?

        % \item Realized \textbf{+ 1} required after thinking there are $n$ iterations
        % between $i = 0$ and $i = n - 1$ when $i = i + 1$.

        % \item Realized \textbf{+ 1} in $\frac{n}{6}$ is required after playing
        % with the following example [0,1,2,3,4,5] and [0,1,2,3,4,5,6].

        % \item Realized $\lceil \frac{5}{6} \rceil = 1$ and $\lceil \frac{6}{6} \rceil = 1$,
        % and indeed \textbf{+ 1} is required to reach loop termination.

        % \item Perhaps the choice of ceiling and floor can be determined by playing with examples.

    \item

    Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Part 1 (Determining maximum and minimum possible change in a single iteration):}

    \bigskip

    It follows from observation that the minimum possible change occurs when
    $i = i \cdot 2$, and the maximum possible change when $i = i \cdot 3$.

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Part 2 (Determining lower bound and upper bound of loop iteration):}

    \bigskip

    Because we know the smallest possible change occurs when $i = i \cdot 2$
    occurs repeatedly, we can conclude that at $k^{th}$ iteration $i_k$ has
    the lower bound of $2^k$.

    \bigskip

    Similarly, because we know largest possible change occurs when $i = i \cdot 3$
    occurs repeatedly, we can conclude that at $k^{th}$ iteration, $i_k$ has
    the upper bound of $3^k$.

    \bigskip

    Then, by putting together, we can conclude that
    \setcounter{equation}{0}
    \begin{align}
        2^k \leq i_k \leq 3^k
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Part 3 (Determining exact number of iterations for the lower bound and
    upper bound):}

    \bigskip

    Because we know the loop runs until $i_k < n$, we can conclude that
    at lower bound, termination occurs when

    \begin{align}
        i_k &\geq n\\
        2^k &\geq n\\
        \log_2 2^k &\geq \log_2 n\\
        k &\geq \log_2 n
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Using the fact that we are looking for smallest value of $k$, we can calculate that
    for lower bound

    \begin{align}
        k &= \lceil \log_2 n \rceil + 1
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Similarly, for the upper bound, loop terminates when

    \begin{align}
        i_k &\geq n\\
        3^k &\geq n\\
        \log_3 3^k &\geq \log_3 n\\
        k &\geq \log_3 n
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Using the fact, we can calculate that for upper bound,

    \begin{align}
        k = \lceil \log_3 n \rceil + 1
    \end{align}

    \textbf{Part 4 (Determining Big-Oh and Omega):}

    \bigskip

    Because we know $\log_2 n$ dominates $\log_3 n$, we can conclude
    $\log_2 n$ is the asymptotic upper bound, and $\log_3 n$ is the asymptotic lower bound.

    \bigskip

    Then, we can conclude the algorithm has $\mathcal{O}(\log_2 n)$ and $\Omega(\log_3 n)$.

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Notes:}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item How come in solution, \textbf{+1} doesn't exist? What rules of thumb
        i can follow to better determine whether \textbf{+1} should be included?
    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Question 2}
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item

    Because we know $n \in \Theta(n^2)$, we can conclude the algorithm has runtime
    of $\Theta(n^2)$.
