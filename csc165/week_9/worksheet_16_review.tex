\section*{Question 1}
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item

    Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

    \bigskip

    Here, the minimum possible change occurs for the loop variable in a single
    iteration when $i = i + 1$.

    \bigskip

    The maximum possible change occurs for the loop variable in a single
    iteration when $i = i + 6$.

    \bigskip

    The exact upper bound of the variable after k iteration is

    \begin{align}
        i_k &\leq 6k
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    The exact lower bound of the variable after k iteration is

    \begin{align}
        k &\leq i_k
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Using the fact that the termination occurs when $i_k = n$, we can calculate
    that for the upper bound, the loop terminates when

    \begin{align}
        6k &\geq n\\
        k &\geq \frac{n}{6}
    \end{align}

    Because we know $\frac{n}{6}$ may be a decimal, we can conclude the closest value at
    which the loop terminates is when

    \begin{align}
        k &= \left\lceil \frac{n}{6} \right\rceil
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Using the same fact, we can calculate that for the lower bound, the loop
    terminates when

    \begin{align}
        k &\geq n
    \end{align}

    It follows from above that for the lower bound, the smallest value of $k$ at which
    the loop termination occurs is when

    \begin{align}
        k &= n
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Then, we can conclude the function has asymptotic lower bound of $\Omega(n)$, and
    asymptotic upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(n)$.

    \bigskip

    Then, since both $\Omega$ and $\mathcal{O}$ have the same value, $\Theta(n)$
    is also true.

        Here, the minimum possible change occurs for the loop variable in a single
        iteration when $i = i + 1$.

        The exact lower bound of the variable after k iteration is

        \begin{align}
            k &\leq i_k

        \bigskip

        Using the fact that the termination occurs when $i_k = n$, we can calculate
        that for the upper bound, the loop terminates when

        \begin{align}
            6k &\geq n\\
            k &\geq \frac{n}{6}
        \end{align}

        Because we know $\frac{n}{6}$ may be a decimal, we can conclude the closest value at
        which the loop terminates is when

            k &= \left\lceil \frac{n}{6} \right\rceil \color{red}+1\color{black}
        \end{align}

        \bigskip

        Using the same fact, we can calculate that for the lower bound, the loop
        terminates when

        \begin{align}
            k &\geq n
        \end{align}

        It follows from above that for the lower bound, the smallest value of $k$ at which
        the loop termination occurs is when

        \begin{align}
            k &= n \color{red}+1\color{black}
        \end{align}

        \bigskip

        Then, we can conclude the function has asymptotic lower bound of $\Omega(n)$, and
        asymptotic upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(n)$.

        \bigskip

        Since both $\Omega$ and $\mathcal{O}$ have the same value, $\Theta(n)$
        is also true.

    \textbf{Notes:}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Realized \textbf{+ 1} required after thinking there are $n$ iterations
        between $i = 0$ and $i = n - 1$ when $i = i + 1$.

        \item Realized \textbf{+ 1} in $\frac{n}{6}$ is required after playing
        with the following example [0,1,2,3,4,5] and [0,1,2,3,4,5,6].

        \item Realized $\lceil \frac{5}{6} \rceil = 1$ and $\lceil \frac{6}{6} \rceil = 1$,
        and indeed \textbf{+ 1} is required to reach loop termination.

        \item Perhaps the choice of ceiling and floor can be determined by playing with examples.

    \end{itemize}


    \item

    Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

    \bigskip

    The minimum possible change occurs when $i = i \cdot 2$.

    \bigskip

    The maximum possible change occurs when $i = i \cdot 3$.

    \bigskip

    Next, we will determine the exact lower bound of loop iteration.

    \bigskip

    Because we know $i = i \cdot 2$ increases smallest, we can conclude the smallest
    possible change in $i$ will result when $i = i \cdot 2$ happens entirely.

    \bigskip

    Then, it follows from above that at $k^{th}$ iteration, the smallest value
    of $i$ is $2^k$.

    \bigskip

    For

    \bigskip

    Given this, the value of $i$ at $k^{th}$ iteration is $3^k$.

    \bigskip

    Using the above fact, the exact upper bound and the lower bound of the
    loop iteration is

    \setcounter{equation}{0}
    \begin{align}
        2^k \leq i_k \leq 3^k
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Now, we will determine the asymptotic running time of the upper bound
    $i_k \leq 3^k$.

    \bigskip

    We want
