\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item

    For every set of size 0 has 0 subsets of size 2.

    \item

    Let $n = 0$. Let $S$ be an arbitrary set. Assume $S$ has size 0.

    \bigskip

    Since $S$ has size 0, empty subsets are the \textbf{only} subsets that can be included
    in S.

    \bigskip

    Then, because we know empty subsets have size 0, we can conclude there are 0
    subsets of size 2.

    \bigskip

    It follows from above that the base case holds.

        Since $S$ has size 0, empty subsets are the \textbf{only} subsets that can be included
        in S.

        Then, because we know an empty subset have size 0, we can conclude there are 0

    Now we will prove inductive step.

    \bigskip

    Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Assume every set of size $k$ has $\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$
    subsets of size 2.

    \bigskip

    We want to show a set of size $k+1$ has $\frac{(k+1)k}{2}$ subsets of size 2.

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Part 1: counting subsets of $S$ of size 2 that contain $s_{k+1}$}}

    \bigskip

    It follows from the table below,

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        k & Sets & Subsets of Size 2 with $s_{k+1}$\\
        \hline
        0 & $\{0,1\}$ & 1\\
        \hline
        1 & $\{0,1,2\}$ & 2\\
        \hline
        2 & $\{0,1,2,3\}$ & 3\\
        \hline
        2 & $\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ & 4\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}

    that the number of subsets of size 2 that contain $s_{k+1}$ is $k+1$.

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Part 2: counting subsets of $S$ of size 2 that doesn't contain $s_{k+1}$}}

    \bigskip

    Because we know the subset of $S$ that doesn't contain $s_{k+1}$ is a set S
    of size k, we can conclude using induction hypothesis that there are

    \begin{align}
        \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
    \end{align}

    subsets of size 2.

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Part 3: Putting the counts together}}

    \bigskip

    Then,

    \begin{align}
        \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) &= \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Then, it follows from proof by induction that the statement '$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$,
    every set of size n has $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ subsets of size 2' is true for all
    natural numbers n.

        \underline{\textbf{Part 2: counting subsets of $S$ of size 2 that doesn't contain $s_{k+1}$}}

        \bigskip

        Because we know the subset of $S$ that doesn't contain $s_{k+1}$ is a set S
        of size $k$, we can conclude using induction hypothesis that there are

        \color{red}
        \begin{align}
            \frac{k(k-1)}{2}
        \end{align}

        subsets of size 2.

        Then,

        \end{align}
        \color{black}

        \bigskip

        Then, it follows from proof by induction that the statement '$\forall \color{red}k\color{black} \in \mathbb{N}$,
        every set of size \color{red}$k$\color{black} has \color{red}$\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$\color{black} subsets of size 2' is true for all

\section*{Question 2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item

    \textbf{Statement:} For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, every finite set $S$ of size $n$,
    has

    \setcounter{equation}{0}
    \begin{align}
        \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}
    \end{align}

    subsets of size 3.

    \bigskip

    We will prove this statement by using induction on $n$.

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Base Case:}

    \bigskip

    Let $n = 0$.

    \bigskip

    Then, only the empty subsets can be included in $S$.

    \bigskip

    Because an empty subset has size 0, there are 0 subsets of size 3 in S.

    \bigskip

    Then, since

    \begin{align}
        \frac{0 \cdot (0-1)(0-2)}{6} &= 0
    \end{align}

    the base case holds.

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Inductive Case:}

    \bigskip

    Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Assume every finite set $S$ of size $k$ has exactly
    $\frac{k(k-1)(k-2)}{6}$ subsets of size 3.

    \bigskip

    We want to show finite set $S$ of size $k+1$ contains $\frac{(k+1)k(k-1)}{6}$
    subsets of size 3.

    \bigskip

    It follows from the table below

    \bigskip

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        k & Sets & \# of Subsets of Size 3 & \# of Subsets of Size 2\\
        \hline
        0 & $\{\}$ & 0 & 0\\
        \hline
        1 & $\{s_0\}$ & 0 & 0\\
        \hline
        2 & $\{s_0,s_1\}$ & 0 & 1\\
        \hline
        3 & $\{s_0,s_1,s_2\}$ & 1 & 3\\
        \hline
        4 & $\{s_0,s_1,s_2,s_3\}$ & 4 & 6\\
        \hline
        5 & $\{s_0,s_1,s_2,s_3,s_4\}$ & 10 & 10\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}

    we can deduce that given a set S size $k+1$, the number of subsets of size 3
    containing $s_{k+1}$ is the sum of \# of subsets of size 3 that doesn't
    contain $s_{k+1})$ and \# of subsets of size 2 that doesn't contain $s_{k+1}$.

    \bigskip

    Then,

    \begin{align}
        \frac{k(k-1)(k-2)}{6} + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} &= \frac{k(k-1)(k-2)}{6} + \frac{3k(k-1)}{6}\\
        &= \frac{k(k-1)(k-2+3)}{6}\\
        &= \frac{k(k-1)(k+1)}{6}
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    \begin{mdframed}
        \underline{\textbf{Attempt \#2:}}

        \bigskip

        \textbf{Statement:} For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, every finite set $S$ of size $n$,
        has

        \setcounter{equation}{0}
        \begin{align}
            \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}
        \end{align}

        subsets of size 3.

        \bigskip

        We will prove this statement by using induction on $n$.

        \bigskip

        \textbf{Base Case:}

        \bigskip

        Let $n = 0$.

        \bigskip

        Then, only the empty subsets can be included in $S$.

        \bigskip

        Because an empty subset has size 0, there are 0 subsets of size 3 in S.

        \bigskip

        Then, since

        \begin{align}
            \frac{0 \cdot (0-1)(0-2)}{6} &= 0
        \end{align}

        the base case holds.

        \bigskip

        \textbf{Inductive Case:}

        \bigskip

        Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Assume every finite set $S$ of size $k$ has exactly
        $\frac{k(k-1)(k-2)}{6}$ subsets of size 3.

        \bigskip

        \color{red}
        We want to show finite set $S$ of size $k+1$ contains $\frac{(k+1)k(k-1)}{6}$
        subsets of size 3. We will do that by determining the number of subsets of size
        3 including $s_{k+1}$, and the number of subsets of size 3 not including $s_{k+1}$,
        and then combining them together.

        \bigskip

        First, we will show the number of subsets of size 3 including $s_{k+1}$
        is $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

        \bigskip

        Because we know the number of subsets of size 3 (i.e $\{a_1,a_2,s_{k+1}\}$)
        containing $s_{k+1}$ depends on the unique combination of first two elements $a_1$ and $a_2$,
        and because we know

        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
            \item $a_1 \neq a_2$
            \item $a_1,a_2 \in \{s_0,s_1,\dots,s_k\}$
        \end{enumerate}

        , we can conclude that the number of subsets of size 3 containing $s_{k+1}$
        is exactly the number of subsets of size 2 in a set $S$ of size $k$ or

        \begin{align}
            \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
        \end{align}

        \bigskip

        Second, we will show the number of subsets of size 3 not including $s_{k+1}$
        is $\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}$.

        \bigskip

        Since the number of subsets of size 3 not containing $s_{k+1}$ must contain
        3 elements from $\{s_0,\dots,s_k\}$, this is exactly number of subsets of size
        3 in a set S of size $k$, or

        \begin{align}
            \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}
        \end{align}

        by induction hypothesis.

        \bigskip

        \color{black}

        Then,

        \begin{align}
            \frac{n(n-1)}{2} + \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} &= \frac{3n(n-1)}{6} + \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}\\
            &= \frac{n(n-1)}{6} \cdot (3 + n - 2)\\
            &= \frac{n(n-1)(n+1)}{6}
        \end{align}
    \end{mdframed}

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Notes:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I wonder if table like above can be used in a proof. If not, why
        can't it be done? If yes, when is the use of table not valid? How should
        it be constructed that it's valid?

        \item Can I put a subheader like 'Part 1: counting subsets of $S$ of size 2
        that contain $s_{k+1}$' in a proof? If so, are there anything that I should be
        aware/be careful of?

        \item Is it alright to play with examples when I don't know how to proceed?
        What's the danger to this approach?

        \item Noticed that professor lays out the big ideas of proof (proof by induction
        evaluating number of $s_{k+1}$ and $s_k$) and then fills in the missing detail
    \end{itemize}

\section*{Question 3}
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item

    \underline{\textbf{Subsets that contain 3:}}

    \bigskip

    $\{ \{3\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\} \}$

    \bigskip

    \underline{\textbf{Subsets that doesn't contain 3:}}

    \bigskip

    $\{ \{\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\} \}$

    \item

    Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

    We will prove the statement using induction on $n$.

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Base Case:}

    \bigskip

    Let $n = 0$.

    \bigskip

    We will show $\mid \mathcal{P}(\{\}) \mid$ and $2^0$ are equal.

    \bigskip

    Because we know $S$ with size 0 is an empty set and $\mathcal{P}(\{\}) = \{\{\}\}$,
    we can conclude

    \setcounter{equation}{0}
    \begin{align}
        \mid \mathcal{P}(\{\}) \mid &= \mid \{\{\}\} \mid\\
        &= 1
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    Because we know $2^{(0)} = 1$, we can conclude $\mid \mathcal{P}(\{\}) \mid = 2^0$

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Inductive Case:}

    \bigskip

    Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Assume $\mid \mathcal{P}(\{s_0,\dots,s_n\}) \mid = 2^n$.

    \bigskip

    We will show $\mid \mathcal{P}(\{s_0,\dots,s_n,s_{n+1}\}) \mid = 2^{n+1}$ by
    finding the number of subsets containing $s_{n+1}$ and the number of subsets
    not containing $s_{n+1}$, and then combining the result together.

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Part 1 Determining number of subsets containing $s_{n+1}$}:

    Because we know a subset containing $s_{n+1}$ can be decomposed into two parts
    $S_n' \cup \{s_{n+1}\}$ where $S_n'$ is a subset with combination of elements in
    $\{\phi, s_0,\dots,s_n\}$, we can conclude that the number of subsets containing
    $s_{n+1}$ is exactly $\mid \mathcal{P}(\{s_0,\dots,s_n\}) \mid$, or

    \begin{align}
        2^n
    \end{align}

    using induction hypothesis.

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Part 2 Determining number of subsets not containing $s_{n+1}$}:

    Because we know the subsets don't have $s_{n+1}$, we can conclude that
    the subsets are combination of elements in $\{\phi, s_0,\dots,s_n\}$.

    \bigskip

    Since this is exactly, $\mid \mathcal{P}(\{s_0,\dots,s_n\}) \mid$, using induction
    hypothesis, we can conclude that the number of subsets not containing $s_{n+1}$
    is

    \begin{align}
        2^n
    \end{align}

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Part 3 Combining together}:

    Since $\mid \mathcal{P}(s_0,\dots,s_n,s_{n+1}) \mid$ is the sum of the
    number of subsets containing $s_{n+1}$ and the number of subsets not containing
    $s_{n+1}$, we have

    \begin{align}
        \mid \mathcal{P}(s_0,\dots,s_n,s_{n+1}) \mid &= 2^n + 2^n
    \end{align}

    Then, it follows from the fact $2^n + 2^n = 2^{n+1}$ that

    \begin{align}
        \mid \mathcal{P}(s_0,\dots,s_n,s_{n+1}) \mid &= 2^{n+1}
    \end{align}

    \textbf{Notes:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How can the phrase 'every set $S$ of size n' be described using
        predicate logic?
        \item How we know if we are over doing/over thinking it? How do we know
        if a proof is not enough or has missing detail or jumping to conclusion?
